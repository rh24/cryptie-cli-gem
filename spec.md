# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
      The CLI will greet the user and provide a basic list of menu options for delving further into the application.
- [x] Pull data from an external source
      This CLI gem scrapes data from coinmarketcap.com, focusing on cryptocurrencies and their attributes.
- [x] Implement both list and detail views
