# Cryptie

This Ruby Gem scrapes cryptocurrency information from CoinMarketCap.com and provides a CLI for users to look up figures for each coin as well as simulate orders. Note, that costs of each coin will differ on actual trading exchanges, so calculations in this gem will only reflect rough estimations of real-world orders.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cryptie-cli-gem'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cryptie-cli-gem

## Usage

Run: `cryptie-cli-gem` after installation.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
